Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems and involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products. It is important in the tech industry in that it enables the creation of software applications and systems that solve societal problems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages,
2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline,
3. Advent of structured programming, and
4. Rise of agile methodologies.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements. Involves obtaining user needs and system requirements.
2. Design. Involves coming up with the system's architecture.
3. Implementation. Writing code.
4. Testing. To ensure the software is functional and that it meets the set standards.
5. Deployment: Releasing the software to end users.
6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall involves sequential approach with distinct phases while agile methodologies use iterative and incremental approach.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer writes and implements code.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer ensures the software meets the quality standards.
3. Project Manager is in charge of planning and organizational tasks.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs offer the environment for implementing code and they offer a user interface for software developers e.g VS Code. VCSs are crucial in tracking changes in the implementation of code and it helps developers to collaborate and thus work on a single project silmutaneously e.g Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Change of requirements
2. Technical debt
3. Tight deadlines
Strategiesto overcome the challenges include effective communication, use of agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing involves testing individual modules(units) of the system.
2. Integration testing involves testing interactions between various modules.
3. System testing focuses on the entire system, and
4. Acceptance testing involves testing the system to see if it meets the user requirements gathered in the first phase of development.
Software Quality Assurance helps identify and fix defects early in the development process.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
It is important in developing systems that can think and operate like humans thus solve societal problems such as healthcare.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Write a birthday message to a friend.
Improved prompt: Write a birthday to a female friend who just turned 25 years, her name is Joy.
Explanation: The improved prompt is effective because unlike the first one, it specifies that the friend is turning 25 years and that their name is Joy. It also tells the model that the friend is female. This makes it clearer and will definitely result to a more effective response, like would come from a human being.
The following is the implementation of both prompts and the corresponding responses as received from Gemini:
